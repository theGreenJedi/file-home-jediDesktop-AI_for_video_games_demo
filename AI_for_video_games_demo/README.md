This is the code for "Introduction to AI for Video Games" by Siraj Raval on Youtube

# Coding Challenge - Due Date, Thursday November 23rd, 2017 at 12 PM PST

This weeks coding challenge is to use the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) library to build a simple value iteration algorithm for any of the available environments. Use the learning resources I've listed in the video description for more help with this. I'll announce the top 2 entries next week, post your github link in the comment section of the video! I will personally review your code. Bonus points for good documentation, Good luck!

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/i_McNBDP9Qs) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of the "AI for Video Games" course. In this first video I just introduce the idea of reinforcement learning and barely introduce the phrases "policy iteration" and "value iteration". I will go way more in depth next week. 

## Dependencies

* numpy
* [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/)

## Usage

You can run both using `python whatever_class_name.py` in terminal once dependencies are installed

## Credits

The credits for this code go to [malzantot](]https://gist.github.com/malzantot). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
